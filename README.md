# Resume Builder
## by Agnieszka Mogelnicki, Grant Schlimgen, Jason Noyes, & Meghna Patel

### Seeking to build a secure, interactive, self-filling template for building a resume. This website is designed to collect relevant information and display it on an intuitive, organized and printable page.

### How to Use:
  Upon entering the page, new users will be greeted with a login page, with the option to register. The "register" page will ask for user's first and last name, their email address, their phone number, and a password. Each piece of information is necessary as some are required to fill out the resume template.
  
  After registering, new builders will be greeted with a home page where they can write personal notes for their own benefit. The navigation bar lists three options as well as a fourth button to log out. Clicking the link in the top left corner will return to the home page, while clicking "Resume data" will take you to forms that must be completed to build the resume. Finally, the "Forms" link leads to the page where the resume itself is built.
  
  There are four forms to complete in all, Education, Experience, Personal & Extra. Any partial completion will be met with an alert asking to fill in the remaining blanks, as every form input is necessary to have a completed resume. Otherwise, all that will appear on the "Forms" page is a warning detailing missing information.
  
  Once all form sections are done, clicking on the "Forms" page will lead to a completed resume, able to view and print directly from the page into a .pdf format!
  
### Technologies Used:
  This application uses multiple databases through MongoDB to store necessary information in the backend, with a React frontend to properly display the requested pieces in a clear and easy-to-read format.
  
### Unfinished Functionality:
  The main issue with the initial version of this application is the styling of the PDF. At this time, it is recommended to use the print shortcut (Ctrl+P) while the developers fix any bugs so the PDF displays properly. Thank you.
